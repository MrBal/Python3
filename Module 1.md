# Module 1: Getting Started ðŸš€

## Introduction
Welcome to Module 1 of the Python 3 Programming Tutorial Series! In this module, we will get started with Python 3 by covering the basics and setting up our development environment.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Python 3 and its features
- Installing Python 3 on different platforms
- Exploring Python IDEs and text editors
- Understanding Python 3 versions and their differences

## Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy
- Passion for learning programming

## Getting Python 3
To start coding in Python 3, you'll need to install it on your computer. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

### Windows
1. Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Navigate to the Downloads section.
3. Choose the latest Python 3.x version (e.g., Python 3.9.5).
4. Click on the installer suitable for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).
5. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
6. Enable the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" option during installation (recommended).

### macOS
1. Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Navigate to the Downloads section.
3. Choose the latest Python 3.x version (e.g., Python 3.9.5).
4. Click on the macOS installer (.dmg) file.
5. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

### Linux
Python 3 usually comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions. Open a terminal and type the following command to check if Python is already installed:

python3 --version


If Python is not installed, use your distribution's package manager to install it. For example, on Ubuntu, run the following command:

sudo apt-get install python3


## Setting Up the Development Environment
Once you have Python 3 installed, you need to set up your development environment. There are various Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and text editors available. Here are some popular options:

- PyCharm (IDE)
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Sublime Text (Text Editor)
- Atom (Text Editor)

Choose the one that suits your preferences and install it on your computer. Familiarize yourself with the basic features and interface of your chosen development environment.

## Understanding Python 3 Versions
Python 3 has different versions, such as 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and so on. While the core syntax and concepts remain the same across versions, there might be some differences in features and libraries. In this tutorial series, we will primarily focus on Python 3.x, where "x" represents the latest stable version available at the time of creating this tutorial.

## Let's Get Started!
Now that you have Python 3 installed and your development environment set up, you are ready to dive into Python programming. In the next module, we will explore the basic building blocks of Python, including variables, data types, and operators. Let's start our Python journey!
