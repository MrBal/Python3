Module 3: Advanced Topics ðŸš€
Introduction
ðŸ“š Welcome to Module 3 of the Python 3 Programming Tutorial Series! In this module, we will explore advanced topics in Python programming to expand your knowledge and skills. We will cover object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, modules and packages, regular expressions, and error handling techniques.

Topics Covered

ðŸ’¡ Encapsulation and Abstraction

Encapsulating data and methods within a class.
Implementing abstraction for hiding implementation details.
2. File Handling
ðŸ’¡ Opening and Closing Files

Opening files in different modes (read, write, append).
Closing files using the close() method and the with statement.
ðŸ’¡ Reading and Writing Files

Reading files using the read() and readline() methods.
Writing to files using the write() method and the print() function.
ðŸ’¡ File Positions and Seek

Understanding the file position and moving the cursor using the seek() method.
Getting the current file position with the tell() method.
3. Modules and Packages
ðŸ’¡ Importing Modules

Importing modules to access their functions and variables.
Using aliases for module names.
ðŸ’¡ Creating Modules

Organizing code into modules for better organization and reusability.
Defining functions and variables in modules.

Sub and subn methods.
5. Error Handling Techniques
ðŸ’¡ Exceptions and Error Types

Understanding exceptions and different error types in Python.
Commonly encountered exceptions.
ðŸ’¡ Handling Exceptions with try-except

Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
Handling specific exceptions and multiple exceptions.
ðŸ’¡ The finally Block and Clean-up Actions
